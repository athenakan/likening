		Hi, and thanks for using this app!
	</p>
	<p>
		First, type your friend's name in the search bar provided, and click Submit.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wait a few moments; it should automatically take you to your friend's Facebook timeline.*
	</p>
	<p>
		At this point, you should see a little box at the top right labeled "Options".  Go ahead and click whichever button you'd like!
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanks for trying us out!
	</p>
	<p>
		*If for some reason the extension does not take you to your friend's timeline, you may manually go to your friend's timeline and click the "Change Page" button on the top right.  This will take you to the "Options" page.
	</p>
