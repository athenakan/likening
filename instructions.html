		Hi, and thanks for using this app!
	</p>
	<p> 
		Before we begin, we would like to put out a disclaimer.
		OVERUSE OF THIS EXTENSION MAY LEAD TO A TEMPORARY OR POSSIBLY PERMANENT BAN FROM FACEBOOK.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, type your friend's name in the search bar provided, and click Search or hit Enter.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wait a few moments; it should automatically take you to your friend's Facebook timeline.*
	</p>
	<p>
		When you are on your friend's Facebook timeline, the extension should have changed to a new page.  Then, Hover over "Like" and then you can choose to like all the posts, comments, or photos on that friend's timeline.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice if you hover over "Like Photos", it will take you to a drop-down menu with two options.  First click "Go To Photos"; this will automatically take you to the friend's photos page.  Then, click "Like Photos"; this will like all of your friend's photos.
		But also notice this method will only like the photos under "Photos of ____".  If you want to like the photos under "_____'s Photos", you must manually go to that section, click on the extension, click "Change Page", hover over "Like Photos", and then click "Like Photos".
	</p>
	<p>
		When you click a "Like" button, an "Undo" button appears.  Clicking this button will unlike all the current likes you just did.  Once you click out of the extension, the "Undo" button cannot undo any previous likes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thanks for trying us out!
	</p>
	<p>
		*If for some reason the extension does not take you to your friend's timeline, you may manually go to your friend's timeline and click the "Change Page" button on the top right.  This will take you to the "Options" page.
